ehtim (eht-imaging)
===================

Python modules for simulating and manipulating VLBI data and producing images with regularized maximum likelihood methods. This version is an early release so please raise an issue, submit a pull request, or email achael@princeton.edu if you have trouble or need help for your application.

The package contains several primary classes for loading, simulating, and manipulating VLBI data. The main classes are the ``Image``, ``Movie``, ``Array``, ``Obsdata``, ``Imager``, and ``Caltable`` classes, which provide tools for loading images and data, producing simulated data from realistic u-v tracks,  calibrating, inspecting, and  plotting data, and producing images from data sets in various polarizations using various data terms and regularizing functions.
